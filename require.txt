> we need controll valves to regulate the amount of water being removed either by opening or closing them. solenod valves are 
commonly used.
> 🚧 we need a database to be able  to store soil mosture levels, crop water consumption rates, recomemnded irrigation
schedles. we should also store amount of water in the tank, amount of water that has been used at what intervals, rates
of evaporation type of the crop  number of water requirements.

>🗽 additionally an API will be used to be able to get real time weather  to make irrigation decisions or use the

- We need a website that the farmer can be able to see the amount of water used and the time irrigation took place.
- We can also send the farmer a message with the information.
- The farmer in the website should be able to see real time updates on soil mosture sensor,Weather conditions and adjust
irrigation settings remotely.
- We will connect with GSM (global system of mobile communications). to use data an later to use wifi.
