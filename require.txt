    -Balance of processing power and powerefficiency
    - Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for wirelessconnectivity
    - Real-time dataprocessing and communication support
    - Suitable for battery-powered applications🛳️

> we need controll valves to regulate the amount of water being removed either by opening or closing them. solenod valves are 
commonly used.
> 🚧 we need a database to be able  to store soil mosture levels, crop water consumption rates, recomemnded irrigation
schedles. we should also store amount of water in the tank, amount of water that has been used at what intervals, rates
of evaporation type of the crop  number of water requirements.

>🗽 additionally an API will be used to be able to get real time weather  to make irrigation decisions or use the light sensor.or what type of sensor can i use.

> 🥁 communication modules .
- We need a website that the farmer can be able to see the amount of water used and the time irrigation took place.
- We can also send the farmer a message with the information.
- The farmer in the website should be able to see real time updates on soil mosture sensor,Weather conditions and adjust
irrigation settings remotely.
- We will connect with GSM (global system of mobile communications). to use data an later to use wifi.

>🥁 improvements and suggetions
-offer diffrent crop and  requirements.
-Offer crop nutrient sensor look at npk soil sensor.
- Soloar powered.
- Calculate the rate of evaporation.



>The web APP
- farmer will choose their crop type
-set irrigation schedules 
- monitor soil moisture levels.
- recieve notifications and alerts  about amount of water spent the amount of water remaining in the tank,send faults.
- send weather data i.e it raining etc..
- check the soil health.
- has a  small screen that the user will be able to input data and membrane keypad to write and read crops.
- When the user opens the system they will be able to see the date and age of the plants,and a welcome message for personalization.
- On start the sytem should try to establish connection form me i will use a sim card as a gsm.
- when teh user finished up teh setup the sytem will display nutrients in the soil,amount of water in the tank,
weather application,show data obtained from the sensors.
- the weather parameter wad obtained from the mobile application.
- Show the state of the valve.
- I want to collect the data of when the water was irrigate get the time to see a parttern.
- Be able to double check the values of the sensor by doing triple reads to compare the data.
- check if the plant will servive in the farm .i.e can i check soil types.
- in the future be able to detect the soil type to know the crops that can grow.
- track the rate of evaporation.
- check amount of water in the tank.
- open the solenoid valve and pass water.

- CR2032 battery3.0V
- LM7805 regulatorInput: 7.4V; Output: 5.0V
- MT3608 buck-boost converterInput: 7.4V; Output: 12.0V
- ESP32 microcontrollerInput (Vin): 5.0V; Output (GPIO pins): 3.3V

- Relay module5.0V
- DC solenoid valve12.0V


⛷ LM7805 Voltage Regulator: Converts higher voltage (like 7.4V from batteries) down to a stable 5V to power components like the ESP32 microcontroller.

⛷ MT3608 Buck-Boost Converter: Boosts the 7.4V from your batteries to 12V to power the DC solenoid valve, ensuring it gets the voltage it needs to operate.

⛷ 18650 Batteries (3.7V): Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used as the main power source for your system, providing 3.7V per battery.

⛷ CR2032 Battery (3.0V): A small button-cell battery used to power devices with very low power consumption, like the Real-Time Clock (RTC) module.

⛷ ESP32 Microcontroller: The brain of the system, responsible for controlling the various components (sensors, valves, etc.) and managing the logic for the irrigation system. It operates on 5V but outputs 3.3V on its GPIO pins.

⛷ Real-Time Clock (RTC) Module: Keeps track of time, allowing the irrigation system to operate on a schedule, even if the main power source is interrupted.

⛷ Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensors: Measure soil moisture levels to determine when to trigger the irrigation system.

⛷ LCD I2C Display Module: Displays information such as system status, soil moisture levels, and time, using I2C communication for easy connection to the ESP32.

⛷ Relay Module: Acts as a switch to control high-power devices like the solenoid valve, allowing the ESP32 to turn them on and off safely.

⛷ DC Solenoid Valve: Controls the flow of water in the irrigation system. It requires 12V to operate, and is opened or closed based on the signals from the ESP32 via the relay.
